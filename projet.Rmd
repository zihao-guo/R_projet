```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown
```{r}
library(readr)
thyroid <- read_csv('thyroid.csv', 'show_col_types' = FALSE)
view(thyroid)
problems(thyroid)

```


```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(thyroid)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
